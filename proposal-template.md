## Audience
Students miss out on inschool/inter-school events
Student-led events are hard to organise ticket sales for

## Problems
1. Students miss out on inschool/inter-school events
(Solved by platforms such as eventbrite, but those platforms are more catered towards the professional adult crowd)
2. Student-led events are hard to organise ticket sales for
(personal example)

## Solution
Move everything online.
It's like PayWave but for tickets.

## Assumptions
The enterprise fee that we charge is enough for the venture to earn normal profits and cheaper than the price schools pay for other platforms.
## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because there aren't any products catered to the local Singaporean market.

## Competitors
Raffles: Stamford
Eventbrite

We're better because we 
1. got e-tickets and we don't charge enterprise fees out the wazoo, also we 
2. solve the demand side problem which is that students do not know what events are available in their school
3. helps with ticket sales and publicity, and lowering the cost of advertising (printing of posters and brochures)
