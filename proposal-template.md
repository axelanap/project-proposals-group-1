## Audience
Students miss out on inschool/inter-school events
Student-led events are hard to organise ticket sales for

## Problems
Students miss out on inschool/inter-school events
(Solved by platforms such as eventbrite, but those platforms are more catered towards the professional adult crowd)
Student-led events are hard to organise ticket sales for
(none that we know of)

## Solution
Move everything online.
It's like PayWave but for tickets.

## Assumptions
The enterprise fee that we charge is enough for the venture to earn normal profits and cheaper than the price schools pay for other platforms.
## Unique Selling Point
Our version will succeed because there aren't any products catered to the local Singaporean market.

## Competitors
Edmodo
Ivy
AceLearning

We're better because we got e-tickets and we don't charge enterprise fees out the wazoo.
